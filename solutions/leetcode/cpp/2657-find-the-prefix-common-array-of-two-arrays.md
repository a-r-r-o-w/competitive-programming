# [2657] Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays



### Statement

You are given two **0-indexed** integerpermutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return *the **prefix common array** of* `A` *and* `B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called a**permutation** if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
**Output:** [0,2,3,4]
**Explanation:** At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
**Output:** [0,1,3]
**Explanation:** At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.

```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50`
* `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n`
* `It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.`

### Hints

- Consider keeping a frequency array that stores the count of occurrences of each number till index i.
- If a number occurred two times, it means it occurred in both A and B since theyâ€™re both permutations so add one to the answer.

### Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    vector <int> findThePrefixCommonArray (vector <int>& A, vector <int>& B) {
      const int max = 51;
      std::bitset <max> haveA, haveB;
      int n = A.size();
      std::vector <int> c (n);

      for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        haveA[A[i]] = 1;
        haveB[B[i]] = 1;
        c[i] = (haveA & haveB).count();
      }

      return c;
    }
};
```
