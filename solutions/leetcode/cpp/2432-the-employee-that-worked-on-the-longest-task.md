# [2432] The Employee That Worked on the Longest Task

**[array]**

### Statement

There are `n` employees, each with a unique id from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where `logs[i] = [idi, leaveTimei]` where:

* `idi` is the id of the employee that worked on the `ith` task, and
* `leaveTimei` is the time at which the employee finished the `ith` task. All the values `leaveTimei` are **unique**.



Note that the `ith` task starts the moment right after the `(i - 1)th` task ends, and the `0th` task starts at time `0`.

Return *the id of the employee that worked the task with the longest time.* If there is a tie between two or more employees, return *the **smallest** id among them*.


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** n = 10, logs = [[0,3],[2,5],[0,9],[1,15]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 3 with 3 units of times.
Task 1 started at 3 and ended at 5 with 2 units of times.
Task 2 started at 5 and ended at 9 with 4 units of times.
Task 3 started at 9 and ended at 15 with 6 units of times.
The task with the longest time is task 3 and the employee with id 1 is the one that worked on it, so we return 1.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** n = 26, logs = [[1,1],[3,7],[2,12],[7,17]]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 1 with 1 unit of times.
Task 1 started at 1 and ended at 7 with 6 units of times.
Task 2 started at 7 and ended at 12 with 5 units of times.
Task 3 started at 12 and ended at 17 with 5 units of times.
The tasks with the longest time is task 1. The employees that worked on it is 3, so we return 3.

```

**Example 3:**

```

**Input:** n = 2, logs = [[0,10],[1,20]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 
Task 0 started at 0 and ended at 10 with 10 units of times.
Task 1 started at 10 and ended at 20 with 10 units of times.
The tasks with the longest time are tasks 0 and 1. The employees that worked on them are 0 and 1, so we return the smallest id 0.

```

**Constraints:**
* `2 <= n <= 500`
* `1 <= logs.length <= 500`
* `logs[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= idi <= n - 1`
* `1 <= leaveTimei <= 500`
* `idi != idi+1`
* `leaveTimei` are sorted in a strictly increasing order.

### Hints

- Find the time of the longest task
- Store each employeeâ€™s longest task time in a hash table
- For employees that have the same longest task time, we only need the employee with the smallest ID

### Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int hardestWorker (int n, vector <vector <int>>& logs) {
      std::sort(logs.begin(), logs.end(), [&] (auto &l, auto &r) {
        if (l[1] < r[1])
          return true;
        if (l[1] > r[1])
          return false;
        return l[0] < r[0];
      });
      
      int prev = 0, max = 0, id = -1;
      
      for (int i = 0; i < (int)logs.size(); ++i) {
        int d = logs[i][1] - prev;
        
        if (d > max) {
          max = d;
          id = logs[i][0];
        }
        else if (d == max)
          id = std::min(id, logs[i][0]);
        
        prev = logs[i][1];
      }
      
      return id;
    }
};
```
