# [287] Find the Duplicate Number

**[array, two-pointers, binary-search, bit-manipulation]**

### Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` containing`n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return *thisrepeatednumber*.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums`and uses only constant extra space.


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
**Output:** 2

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
**Output:** 3

```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `nums.length == n + 1`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
* All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.


**Follow up:**
* How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
* Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
