# [2606] Find the Substring With Maximum Cost

**[array, hash-table, string, dynamic-programming]**

### Statement

You are given a string `s`, a string `chars` of **distinct** characters and an integer array `vals` of the same length as `chars`.

The **cost of the substring** is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered `0`.

The **value of the character** is defined in the following way:

* If the character is not in the string `chars`, then its value is its corresponding position **(1-indexed)** in the alphabet.
	+ For example, the value of `'a'` is `1`, the value of `'b'` is `2`, and so on. The value of `'z'` is `26`.
* Otherwise, assuming `i` is the index where the character occurs in the string `chars`, then its value is `vals[i]`.



Return *the maximum cost among all substrings of the string* `s`.


**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** s = "adaa", chars = "d", vals = [-1000]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The value of the characters "a" and "d" is 1 and -1000 respectively.
The substring with the maximum cost is "aa" and its cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum cost.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** s = "abc", chars = "abc", vals = [-1,-1,-1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The value of the characters "a", "b" and "c" is -1, -1, and -1 respectively.
The substring with the maximum cost is the empty substring "" and its cost is 0.
It can be proven that 0 is the maximum cost.

```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
* `1 <= chars.length <= 26`
* `chars` consist of **distinct** lowercase English letters.
* `vals.length == chars.length`
* `-1000 <= vals[i] <= 1000`

### Hints

- Create a new integer array where arr[i] denotes the value of character s[i].
- We can use Kadaneâ€™s maximum subarray sum algorithm to find the maximum cost.

### Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    int maximumCostSubstring (string s, string chars, vector <int>& vals) {
      int sum = 0, max = 0;
      std::vector <int> index (26, -1);
      
      for (int i = 0; i < (int)chars.size(); ++i)
        index[chars[i] - 'a'] = i;
      for (char c: s) {
        if (index[c - 'a'] == -1)
          sum = std::max(c - 'a' + 1, sum + c - 'a' + 1);
        else
          sum = std::max(vals[index[c - 'a']], sum + vals[index[c - 'a']]);
        max = std::max(max, sum);
      }
      
      return max;
    }
};
```
