Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

The result format is in the following example.

+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
**Explanation:** 
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.
Alex did not attend any exams.
John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.

```py
import pandas as pd

def students_and_examinations(students: pd.DataFrame, subjects: pd.DataFrame, examinations: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
  examinations = examinations.groupby(["student_id", "subject_name"]).agg(
    attended_exams=("subject_name", "count")
  ).reset_index()
  return students.merge(subjects, "cross").sort_values(
    by = ["student_id", "subject_name"]
  ).merge(
    examinations, "left", on = ["student_id", "subject_name"]
  ).fillna(0)[["student_id", "student_name", "subject_name", "attended_exams"]]
